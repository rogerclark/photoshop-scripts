photoshop-scripts
=================

Useful JavaScript actions for Photoshop CS5 and later.

Instructions
1. Place scripts in your `/Applications/Adobe Photoshop CSx/Presets/Scripts` folder.
1. Select the action from the **File > Scripts** menu.


Save All.jsx
============

Acts like "Save All" in other applications (text editors, development environments). Prompts the user with a "Save As" dialog for any new documents.

Place Multiple.jsx
==================

The default "Place" action only supports selecting a single file. This action displays a dialog where multiple files can be selected, then places each image as a Smart Object onto your document.
